# PROJECT-TRAIN.
In this project i have tried to make replica of train booking system.
This is Python and MySQL database management based project.
In this project train seats are booked as per users wish.
After booking the seats a mail is sent to the users gmail-id (which is taken while booking") which includes his booking details and a secret code for login during his journey in train on the tablet provided by train authority.
On the tablet passenger can see various details about the trains route & the details of self as well as that of passengers ("limited details will be provided").
LOCAL AS WELL AS ONLINE MySQL DATABASE IS USED.
# We are assuming that in future trains,any other transport will provide a tablet mounted on seats to the passenger's.
